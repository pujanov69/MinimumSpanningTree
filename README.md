# MinimumSpanningTree
Minimum Spanning Tree by the algorithm of Jarnik / Prim


The operator of an airline wants to close flight connections that are currently offered. Due to the current situation, not all flight connections are profitable
between two airports because the cost of carrying it out is too high. The operator would therefore like to discontinue costly flight connections. But he fears that because of this
Endanger the context of his flight network. So he asks you for help and begs
They find out the essential flight connections in more detail, so that the connection
is not endangered. They should also find flight connections with minimal overall costs.
It is of course immediately clear to you that you are asking for a minimal spanning tree.
AirportReducer class with Jarnik / Prim algorithm is implemented.
So implement a class AirportReducer in similar fashion, which implements the BoruvkaSollin algorithm.
(If you are able to implement the algorithm send a Pull Request :) ) 
Use the two auxiliary classes Airport and Connection, which are provided. 
You can assume that the input instances are contiguous.
